# Match3Portfolio

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Match3Portfolio** is a modular, cleanly-architected Match-3 puzzle game developed in Unity as a professional portfolio project.  
The project’s goal is to demonstrate modern Unity development practices, modular game architecture, and a scalable codebase with extensibility in mind.

## 🚀 Why Did I Build This Project?

- To **demonstrate strong Unity architecture** principles in a real-world scenario.
- To show my ability to plan, structure, and implement a clean and scalable game project.
- To create a foundation that is easily extendable for advanced features (like power-ups, chained tiles, boosters, etc.).
- To showcase best practices in mobile game development, UI, optimization, and data-driven design.
- To serve as a “showcase-ready” example for potential employers, freelance clients, and collaborators.

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP Scope)

- Fully playable Match-3 puzzle gameplay (swap, match, clear, refill).
- Data-driven tile and level configuration using ScriptableObjects.
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Event-driven system for UI, score, audio, and game logic communication.
- Simple state machine for game flow (start, playing, animation, game over)..
- Clean and readable codebase, commented and ready for further extension.
- Managing prefabs with object pooling

## ✨ Extensibility & Future Work
- Special tiles (chained, frozen, locked, etc.)
- Boosters (bomb, rocket, disco ball, etc.)
- Online leaderboards and user profiles (Firebase)

**This project is published solely for demonstration and portfolio purposes.**
